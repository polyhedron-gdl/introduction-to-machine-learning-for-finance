    "The success of a machine learning algorithm highly depends on the quality of the data fed into the model. Real-world data is often dirty containing outliers, missing values, wrong data types, irrelevant features, or non-standardized data. The presence of any of these will prevent the machine learning model to properly learn. For this reason, transforming raw data into a useful format is an essential stage in the machine learning process. One technique you will come across multiple times when pre-processing data is feature normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Normalization is a common practice in machine learning which consists of transforming numeric columns to a common scale. In machine learning, some feature values differ from others multiple times. The features with higher values will dominate the leaning process. However, it does not mean those variables are more important to predict the outcome of the model. Data normalization transforms multiscaled data to the same scale. After normalization, all variables have a similar influence on the model, improving the stability and performance of the learning algorithm.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is important to bear in mind that z-scores are not necessarily normally distributed. They just scale the data and follow the same distribution as the original input. This transformed distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 and is going to be the standard normal distribution only if the input feature follows a normal distribution."
